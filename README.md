Stars 2020
==========

THIS CODE HAS A DEPENDENCY ON BallySternOS - it won't build without those files.  

To use this code, download the zip file (Code > Download ZIP) or clone the repository to your hard drive.  
  
Next, get the BallySternOS files ( BallySternOS.* and SelfTestAndAudit.* ) from the repository here: 
https://github.com/BallySternOS/BallySternOS/tree/master

Put all the files from this repository in the same folder as the BallySternOS files and name that folder:
Stars2020  
  
Open the Stars2020.ino in Arduino's IDE, and you can build the project.  
  
Refer to the PDF or Wiki for instructions on how to build the hardware.
